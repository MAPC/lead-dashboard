    <h2>Methodology</h2>

    <p>
      This database currently provides an annual estimation of community-wide energy use, 
      using a methodology developed by MAPC that relies on data from the 
      <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t">American Community Survey</a>, 
      <a href="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2009/index.php?view=consumption">Energy Information Administration surveys</a>, and the 
      <a href="http://lmi2.detma.org/lmi/lmi_es_a.asp">Massachusetts Executive Office of Wages and Labor Division surveys</a>. 
      With access to annual energy use for all 351 municipalities in the Commonwealth, the 
      Local Energy Action Dashboard could provide municipalities with a year over year 
      picture of how community-wide energy use has been impacted by clean energy strategies 
      implemented. MAPC has drafted and filed legislation with the Massachusetts State 
      Legislature to require utilities to provide Massachusetts cities and towns with 
      consistent access to community-wide energy data.
